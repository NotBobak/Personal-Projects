## Background 

Hello there!

My name is Bobak Ahmar and welcome to my project portfolio! A little bit about me, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto where I specialized in Statistics with an emphasis on quantitative finance. During my time at university, I developed a passion for data science, sports analytics, fitness, personal finance and video editing. I mainly spent my time completing projects focused on logistic regression, PCA, factor analysis and time series data.

Now I focus on conducting analysis on any topics that interest me!
