## Background 

Hello there!

My name is Bobak Ahmar and welcome to my project portfolio! A little bit about me, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto where I specialized in Statistics with an emphasis on quantitative finance. During my time at university, I developed a passion for web development, data science, sports analytics, fitness, personal finance and video editing. 

Now I focus on creating projects on any topic that interests me!
