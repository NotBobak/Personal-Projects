# Project 1: Weighted Dice
In this project we assemble R code that will simulate rolling a pair of dice. Then assign new probabilities so the dice are weighted in our favour.

## Main Ideas
 - How to use the R and RStudio interfaces
 - Run basic R commands, built in R functions, create R objects, functions and scripts
 - Load and use R packages
 - Generate random samples and create quick plots
 - How to access and use the help page

## Helpful Tips
 - You can cancel a command once it has begun by pressing ctrl + c
 - You can install multiple packages at once by linking their names with Râ€™s concatenate function
 - The update.packages command checks whether you have the most current version of a package and installs the most current version if you do not
 - To see which packages you currently have in your R library run library()
