# Project 2: Playing Cards
This project consists of 4 main tasks based on managing data with R. 

Building a deck -> Create a deal & shuffle function -> Change to appropriate point system -> Manage the state of the Deck 

## Main Ideas
 - Save new types of data, like character strings and logical values
 - Save a data set as a vector, matrix, array, list, or data frame
 - Load and save your own data sets with R
 - Extract individual values from a data set & Change individual values within a data set
 - Write logical tests
 - Use R’s missing-value symbol, NA
 - R’s environment system and scoping rules

## Helpful Tips
 - R uses NULL to represent the null set, an empty object. NULL is often returned by functions whose values are undefined
 - If you try to put multiple types of data into a vector, R will convert the elements to a single type of data.
 - You can also give names to a list or vector when you create one of these objects, The names will be stored in the object’s names attribute.
 - You can load a plain-text file straight from the Internet by clicking the “From Web URL…” option under Import Dataset
 - If you repeat a number in your index, R will return the corresponding value(s) more than once in your “subset.”
 - Indexing in R behaves just like indexing in linear algebra. The first element is always indexed by 1
 - If you select two or more columns from a data frame, R will return a new data frame. However, if you select a single column, R will return a vector
 - Don't ever use attach()... just don't
 - Functions are a type of object in R. R will store and look up functions the same way it stores and looks up other objects, by searching for them by name in the environment tree
