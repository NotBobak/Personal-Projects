# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python was the first programming language I ever learned. At first I used it for basic calculations and simple apps but I quickly transitioned into using Python for web scraping, data wrangling and various machine learning techniques. I've worked on numerous personal projects in different types of work. This repository holds some of the work that I have completed.
