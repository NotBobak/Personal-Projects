# Programming Projects

### About Me
I was introduced to programming in my junior year of Highschool. I learned how to use Python to simulate fractals and write reports in jupyter notebook. In university I furthur developed my programming ablilities through various courses projects and gained an appreciation for R. From here I began using my programming skills for Data Analaysis during my time as a statistics student.

I've grown to enjoy programming over the years and have tried out data analysis projects, software development projects and web development projects. This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done as a programmer. Currently categorized by programming language and sub-categorized by project type.
